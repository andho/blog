* brand has members.
* members create posts.
* brand trends based on the popularity of the posts published by members.

* let's say Brand A is trending because of Member A.
* Then Memeber A leaves Brand A. Should Brand A stop trending. This is a business decision.
* If Member A is removed from Brand A, then there is no way to get the post information about Member
A associated with Brand A.
* Unless using an event driven model, the posts were associated with the Brand A during the time
  Member A was a member of Brand A.

* Well not really. The posts could have been associated with the Brand A using normal relational
  database too.
