So the other day I was taking a nap, and I spontaneiously started to do calculations. You could guess I wasn't able to get any sleep.
So I ended up thinking about my thought process doing arithmetics, and thought I would write a blog post about it. So here goes:

15 * 5
10 * 5 = 50
5 * 5 =  25
50 + 25 = 75

tadaaa

99/4

100 / 4 = 25
1 / 4   = 0.25

25 - 0.25 = 24.75

tadaaaa
