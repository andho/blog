===================================
A Grassroots Movement for Democracy
===================================

A vision of freedom

Introduction
============

This is a call for mobilizing a grassroots movement to push democracy forward
with the will of the people. We all know that the form of representative
democracy is not working for us. If you talk to someone about
pushing some legislation forward, you will hear the usual, "But it's useless to
put anything into the majilis.

This proposed movement will aim to:

* break the disillusionment or depolicitization of the masses.
* clear process to move this movement forward.
* legitimize the left through practical action.
* make sure the legislation pushed by the left is truely democratic cannot and
  be influenced by oligarchy.
* promote Concensus Decision Making and Direct Democracy.

In the following paragraphs, we will look at a detailed process of how the
movement can galvanize and resolve the will of the people towards active
democratic participation. Then we will show how each of the points noted above
ties into this process.

The major idea of this proposal is Concensus Decision Making and Direct
Democracy as a movement builder. A summary of both of these methods of decision
making will follow, and links to a more detailed explanation of the methods will
be mentioned in the footnotes[1].

Concensus Decision Making
=========================

Concensus Decision Making is a method of achieving concensus on issues through
group discussion and decision making which allows for everyones voice to be
heard, and all concerns resolved unanimously.

What is the focus of the Movement
=================================

To push democracy forward, by pushing Concensus Decision Making and Direct
Democracy and building an alternate structure of legislature that cannot be
ignored by the establishment. And through this structure, to break down the
structures of centralization and replace them with decentralized structures. In
time, through decentralization, the federation can be replaced with a
confederation.

Building the movement
=====================

To start this movement there are some hurdles and barriers that we need to go
through. The following sections will highlight those barries and tools that are
available for us to break down those barriers.

Barriers
--------

There are several barriers we need to tackle in order to give momentum to this
movement.

* Political apathy.
* Disconnect from governance.
* Limited time and will of the average worker.
* In line with the status quo:

  * Effected negatively, but believes it's about luck and hard work.
  * Effected positively, actively benefits from the status quo.

* Beyfulhism and patronage.
* Disillusionment of being small and corporations having too much power.

Tools
-----

These tools can be used:

* Believable bills and regulation that makes people excited about the
  possibilities.
* Active participation in creating said bills and regulations.
* Easing participation through technological and other means.
* Stories/documentaries detailing successes.

Now let's look at how these tools can be used to breakdown those barriers.

Political Apathy
----------------

The ability to tackle political apathy of the citizens will make or break this
movement.

...thinking about politics as a day to day activity.

...in this age of micro attention span.

...Let's try not to overwhelm with fatigue.

Notes
=====

* make bribes expensive by increasing the number of people that has to be
  bribed.
