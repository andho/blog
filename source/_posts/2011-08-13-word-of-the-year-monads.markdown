Its rare that you discover a concept that changes the way you think completely or helps you understand things that you never could before. And its even rarer for that concept to be described by a single word, let alone a word that sounds this cool. MONADS!  

It rhymes with nomads and gonads, two other cool words. Nomads being a way of life that a normal person living in a third world country cannot even imagine living, something we can only dream of. Gonads made cool by popular culture.
