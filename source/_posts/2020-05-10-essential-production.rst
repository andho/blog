 Essential Production
======================

What are the essential reproductive forces
==========================================

The essential reproductive forces are the forces of production that makes sure
that humanity and ecosystem that we live in, survives and reproduces and even
prosper. The most essential elements of reproduction are survival, and then
comes relationships and lastly self actualization.

I will look at survival in this essay. For survival we need to provide everyone
with food, shelter and clothes. But in order to provide these essentials, there
is a huge amount of productivity needed. First comes the production of the
essentials, including the raw materials needed. There also needs to be
transportation during the production, and also after production. And there
should also be a way to dispose of the waste generated by consumption of food
and hygenic activities.

There is a lot of infrastructure needed to provide the essentials for survival
and even for the next levels. We needs roads, power grids, sewerage and water
pipelines, etc.

The most important aspect of the forces of production I want to look at here is
labor. In respect to the essential reproduction, they will be all the under
valued labor like: teachers, sewage workers, farmers, construction workers,
delivery persons, truck drivers, etc.

Likewise, other essential forces of production is also under valued like;
schools, safety equipment for workers, etc. Unless ofcourse, they are
commodified, then those who work in the more expensive of these...

Problem of inefficiency
=======================

A consequence of Capitalism's invisible hand on our economy is that the
essential reproductive forces of the world is valued less and less, and it seems
it is harder for the average person to imagine that we can put more value to
essential reproductive forces.

It's not that the people don't have an idea about how the current status quo is
not good, but it's not understood why it is the way it is. Or it's just believed
to be a natural consequence of "economics" and an assumption that the current
economic system are laws of nature. There is a lot of pop. culture talks about
this absurdity.

But instead all they get is praise, standing ovations and singing from the
balconies. And to top it all off, a day to celebrate their work. Make no
mistake, they do deserve the praise, standing ovations, etc. But they desever so
much more than that.

According to Capitalists the person who does essential work does it because they
don't have the abilities to achieve a better job, they are too lazy, or they
should get a better job if they can.
